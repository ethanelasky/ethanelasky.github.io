    "text": "Reading in and cleaning data\nNow, we read the data in and clean it. We start out by reading in an arbitrary month to get a DataFrame with the correct columns, then loop through each month’s flight records (stored in a csv). We add each month’s flight records to our flights DataFrame; at this point, we are done loading data for this project.\nCleaning the DataFrames involves several steps. To start, we read in this HTML table from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics as a DataFrame. This table matches airlines with abbreviations. To aid legibility, we replace the abbreviations contained in our flights DataFrame with the airlines’ full names.\n\n\nCode\nimport re\n\n#Obtains DataFrame with correct columns\nflights = pd.DataFrame(columns=pd.read_csv(\"data/On_Time_Reporting_Carrier_On_Time_Performance_(1987_present)_2022_5.csv\").columns)\n\n#Concatenates inputs to flights DataFrame\nfor root, directories, filenames in os.walk('data'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        fpath = os.path.join(root,filename)\n        if (fpath[-3:] == 'csv') & (fpath[5:8] == 'On_'):\n            a = pd.read_csv(fpath)\n\n            # Filter out unneeded rows (only keep things relevant to flight origin, airline, and departure delay)\n            a = a.filter(['CRSDepTime', 'DepDelayMinutes', 'Reporting_Airline', 'TaxiOut', 'Origin', 'Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline'], axis=1)\n\n            # Concatenate month table to flights\n            print(f\"  {fpath}\")\n            flights = pd.concat([flights, a], ignore_index=True, join='inner')\n\n# Obtains a DataFrame version of the HTML table on the BTS Airline Codes webpage\ncodes = pd.read_html(\"https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports/airline-codes\")[0]\nflights = flights.merge(right=codes, left_on='Reporting_Airline', right_on='Code', suffixes=['',''])#.drop([\"Reporting_Airline\", 'Code'], axis=1)\n\n\nWe now make a copy of flights called delays. We can now safely transform our data and keep the original flights available for later analysis. We’ll also regularize our time (converting the HHMM format to HH.MM, where MM is out of 100 instead of 60).\n\n\nCode\n# Makes a deep copy of flights called delays for transformation in this section. Filter out on-time flights.\nflights['CRSDepTime'] = flights['CRSDepTime'] % 100 * 5/3 * .01 + flights['CRSDepTime'] // 100\nflights['delay'] = flights['DepDelayMinutes'] &gt; 0\ndelays = flights.copy(deep=True)[flights['DepDelayMinutes'] &gt; 0]"
