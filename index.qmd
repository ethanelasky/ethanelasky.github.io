## About me

I'm a senior studying Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I'm  working on my Data Science honors thesis, in which I am applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to American and Taiwanese news media to understand each's framing/stance/agenda-setting with respect to China. I am advised by [Lucy Li](lucy3.github.io).

At the Haas School of Business, I'm a member of [Angus Hildreth](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jdh362/)'s Social Psychology and Business Lab.

Having studied abroad in Taiwan during Spring 2023 and grown up in the United States, I understand English and Mandarin.

In high school, I was ranked top-50 in Lincoln-Douglas debate nationally and coached for DebateDrills during my freshman year.
