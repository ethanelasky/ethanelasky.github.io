## About me
I am cofounder of [Acaceta](acaceta.com), which is a knowledge solutions platform for medical sales representatives and doctors.

I am currently Research Assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en/) in the Lab of Professor Lun-Wei Ku, where I am researching retrieval-augmented generation strategies and debate between language models as a means of finding truth.

My undergraduate degree (major: Data Science, concentration: Applied Mathematics and Modeling, minor: Chinese Language) is from the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, I wrote an honors thesis, in which I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify media bias in Taiwan. I was advised by [Lucy Li](https://lucy3.github.io).

At the Haas School of Business, I was a member of [Angus Hildreth](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jdh362/)'s Social Psychology and Business Lab for four semesters (Spring 2022-Spring 2024).

I understand English and Mandarin. I studied abroad in Taiwan in Spring 2023 and have returned to Taiwan full-time for work.

In high school, I was ranked top-50 in Lincoln-Douglas debate nationally, and coached for DebateDrills, a nationally successful team, during my freshman and sophomore years of college.
