## About me

I did undergrad (Data Science) at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, I wrote an honors thesis, in which I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify media bias in Taiwan. I am advised by [Lucy Li](https://lucy3.github.io).

At the Haas School of Business, I was a member of [Angus Hildreth](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jdh362/)'s Social Psychology and Business Lab for four semesters (Spring 2022-Spring 2024).

I understand English and Mandarin. I studied abroad in Taiwan in Spring 2023.

In high school, I was ranked top-50 in Lincoln-Douglas debate nationally, and coached for DebateDrills, a nationally successful team, during my freshman and sophomore years.
