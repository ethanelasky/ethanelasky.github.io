The public understands debate as the school equivalent of what happens between political candidates on TV, or maybe as what happens on Ben Shapiro vs. Libs YouTube videos. \n","\n","In reality, the umbrella label of “debate” encompasses two dissimilar activities, “lay” debate and “policy-style” debate. \n","\n","### Lay vs policy-style debate\n","\n","Lay debate is debate meant for a general audience – this involves things like normal speaking cadences, an increased focus on rhetoric, and appeals to traditional values. This is the default mode of debate, and at most county- or state-level tournaments this is what you’ll encounter. At the national level, there are two tournaments per year that focus on lay debate, the [NCFL](https://www.ncfl.org/nationals.html) and [NSDA](https://www.speechanddebate.org/nationals/) Nationals. An example NSDA Nationals lay debate round can be found [here](https://youtu.be/LFFOLNdSOWE?si=siGN5-XKYBHCNgKe&t=100). \n","\n","Policy-style debate is a completely different activity. People speak at double or triple the speed of a normal speaking cadence, the beginning speeches are extremely evidence-heavy, and judges must have training evaluating these types of debates (often gained from having done the activity in the past, but not exclusively). An example round (of my old teammate Rex) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84tWuolWqu0&t=1506s). \n","\n","While it’s possible to do lay debate well alongside other activities, it’s much harder to do policy debate well in the same circumstances. Extreme focus is placed on evidence, so much so that the first speeches almost solely consist of reading evidence “into the record” (this is a legal analogy, but not one we use in debate) for use in rebuttal speeches. Unlike lay debate, in which it’s possible to spend ~25 hours or less on research for a given topic (being generous here), policy-style debate can require hundreds of research per team member per topic. And tournaments occur weekly across the country on the National Circuit, where people vie for [Tournament of Champions](https://uktoc.org) [bids](https://uktoc.org/bid-tournaments/).\n","\n","Lay debate often also mandates that students debate the resolution as stated, while policy-style debate allows people to make more specific advocacies within the resolution’s bounds.\n","\n","For example, a policy-style resolution might read:\n","\n","**Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic and/or diplomatic engagement with the People's. Republic of China.**\n","\n","While a lay debate might be over the merits of more engagement with China generally, a policy-style debate will often instead consist of an affirmative that chooses a type of engagement or a program that they think should be implemented, and the negative must disagree with that specific advocacy. In effect, negatives must be prepared to debate all possible affirmative advocacies, meaning that students will spend well over a thousand hours reading academic journal articles, books, and newspapers for better sources and arguments. There is also a standard of open evidence, meaning that both sides must disclose all previously argued positions and their evidence online at [this wiki](opencaselist.com), and before any debate round, the affirmative must tell the negative side which advocacy they plan to deploy.\n","\n","### Switching sides\n","\n","One commonality between both lay and policy-style debate is the ability to switch sides, which\n","> “increases the chance for good faith debates to emerge and helps strengthen your existing beliefs by helping you find weaknesses in them, both desperately needed in an age where partisanship has made good faith debate difficult if not impossible. This process of switching sides forces students who may never have been exposed to more leftist or radical views to evaluate them on their merits. It forces students to think about how to offer a defense of views they may disagree with, challenging previous strawmen they may have previously believed. Debate, then, provides an obvious mechanism for penetrating filter bubbles by exposing students to a range of views they have previously not considered.” ([Zhou 2021]( https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/10/why-we-should-teach-kids-to-debate))\n","\n","[If you’re interested in even more pro-switch side debate content, see here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2734689). \n","\n","One other feature exclusive to policy-style debate is the introduction of critical theory to both sides. On the negative, this manifests as questioning the assumptions of the affirmative, and on the affirmative, this manifests as an advocacy that may be seen as untopical, and which certainly does not adopt the policy focus that many other affirmatives employ.\n","\n","### A worrisome trend\n","\n","Recently, people on the right like [James Fishback](incubatedebate.org) have been posting out-of-context clips of critical-theory-adopting affirmatives from policy-style debate on Twitter, which predictably has incensed many in his replies. People see this, and without context or knowledge of the immense benefits this type of debate provides students, automatically assume that yet another institution in American society – this time academic debate – has been taken over by leftists.\n","\n","But there are two problems with this view. \n","\n","First, debate is by nature switch-side and internally resolving. It’s not an activity like soccer, where if someone cheats, you might get upset, pause the game, and debate with the other team about the correct call. Debate is self-adjudicating – if an argument is of poor quality or if a side is cheating (which the Twitter audience seems to believe), then they can debate about it – it’s the other team’s job to rebut it. \n","\n","Second, judges. Some people like James and his reply guys also believe that judges are insanely biased towards leftists, like in this [out-of-context clip](https://x.com/j_fishback/status/1720871513849483384?s=46). But besides debaters just being more persuasive, there are several other mechanisms in debate that help students adapt to randomness in judge assignment:\n","- Judge paradigms – judges must post a blurb ([here’s mine](https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml)) explaining their debate/ideological beliefs. This way, debaters can adapt their arguments to their audience, which is an important part of persuasion and ideological flexibility. \n","- Judge preferences – pre-tournament, debaters are able to rank judges based off of preference, and during a tournament, after pairings have been made, debaters are assigned a judge (or a panel of judges) with equivalent ratings from each side. Debaters also get a certain number of strikes, which can be assigned instead of a rating to avoid getting that judge.\n","\n","It’s frustrating to me that some point to debate as another corrupted institution without understanding even the differences between lay and policy-style debate. I agree with the sentiment that debate judges should involve more diverse of profession and age, but to have laypeople judge policy-style debate would be like having laypeople judge the Olympics or other specialized and niche activities. \n","\n","One way to fix this might be to build a stronger tradition of alumni connections – schools asking former debaters and coaches, many of whom have gone on to careers in every field imaginable – to judge a few times a year for the betterment of high school and college students. \n","\n","### Conclusion\n","\n","To its detriment, policy-style debate often gets lumped in with lay debate. People also have little understanding of its benefits. Citing Lawrence Zhou, who himself cites a host of academic studies, debate has the power to motivate students to deeply research, to actively learn (because the stakes of knowledge are victory or loss), to critically think on their feet and logically reason, and to avoid dogmatism and ideological siloes, especially traditionally minoritized students.\n","\n","By fostering a robust culture of alumni involvement and by expanding policy-style debate to more schools, we can ensure that the rich educational benefits of debate—research, critical thinking, logical reasoning, and the dismantling of dogmatism—are preserved and enhanced. Rather than awkwardly acknowledging having done debate (“yeah, I did debate, but it’s probably not like what you think. Here, I can show you a video of me talking really quickly,”), we must further differentiate policy-style debate from lay debate in the public eye and encourage further participation, especially from myriad alumni who have already reaped the benefits of the activity. In doing so, we build a community that not only appreciates the art of policy-style debate but also upholds it as a cornerstone of our democratic society.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
