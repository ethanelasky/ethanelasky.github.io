Since leaving Taiwan, I've delved into the island's indie music scene, taking recommendations from PTT (Taiwan's Reddit equivalent), my friend Yang Lee, and the Spotify algorithm. The selections I've listed below are eclectic, ranging from siren-like female vocals over jazz piano to poppy, guitar-heavy satire of Japanese magical girl anime. Taiwan's alternative scene is not merely derivative of Japan's, the West's, or anywhere else—the music is creative and unique, reminding me of the enormity and potential of what's still out there to discover.

Note: Translations are mine. Search for songs using the Chinese name if available. [Here's](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2GTvo88QMO0ohpefCClJI6?si=4d0fc99d1a444252) a Spotify playlist with every song in this reflection, plus many more.

### Hello Nico

Hello Nico is not a loud band. But their songs are no less powerful because of it. The lyrics sometimes take the form of recollections, looking doubtfully at past decisions; other songs embody a more positive note.

Selections:

- Flower/Hua 花 is an apologetic contemplation of what could have been, had the speaker not unintentionally hurt Hua (a pet name for the subject). The relationship is left ambiguous, and ruined clothes are a recurring subject (likely standing for reputational harm). [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wsrAPGfAsFOPwsU46l5Vm?si=9a68958947b24fbe)

- Unfamiliar Room, Unfamiliar Afternoon 陌生的房間陌生的下午 is the perfect "sad" Taiwanese indie song, if that's what you're looking for. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/31BGdCvAt3SNBzgtDbEqRg?si=a7b5d542e491472b)

- Facing Yourself 面向自己 embodies "breathiness" (which is popular in Japanese music) and magnificently uses color and light-based metaphors to describe the uniqueness of the speaker's romantic interest. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JhpzFv4v5wVnu2rZCMn5h?si=83c4e1c3714142bb)


### Iruka Porisu (aka Dolphin Police, イルカポリス, 海豚刑警)

Iruka Porisu's 2019 album Call me when Night go Blue is one of my favorites of 2023. Songs effortlessly mesh the lead singer Wuyue's (伍悅) siren-like voice, intense guitar solos, and unconventional instruments like a kid's piano. Their music, lyrics, social media profiles, and videos embody youth—irreverent, chaotic, and joyful—and remind me to enjoy mine while it lasts. Check out their music videos, which I've linked below.

Selections:

- Lights of Anping 安平之光 describes blithely riding a Vespa around Anping, Tainan, away from depressing Taipei. [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ZrpZB8-VBD0?si=i67yOTFIXKyImhOV), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/5vW8NkquQ1WgJUtyS7pwJx?si=35d1a9a8b5e5410e)

- When You Tell Me You Dreamed of Me in Deep Sleep 當ㄋ沉睡ㄉ時候告訴婐ㄋ夢到ㄌ婐 is an enthralling song about love and longing in a relationship with a pessimist. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v_qdAXu5p4), [YouTube acoustic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgt9UkQz6k8), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3zLdMtVS1ku6ACHDGy1oXi?si=49f9e896380b4810)

- Young Folks Die Late is full of harmonic tension and discusses the previous night's sexual partner for misunderstanding the speaker. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/q8I0Ahl2y2c?si=EHAi2UMomAPkWDI_), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4olMBqpE3xKbmgc4s2WOGl?si=cde8c30b53d84347)

- Badminton Youth 羽球少年 describes the speaker's romantic frustrations with men, women, and the available partners in her environment. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/7rAMxhio3gkeUzn5HoUMmo?si=c265f9962485465d)


### Elephant Gym (大象體操)

![Image source: Taiwan Beats](https://taiwanbeats.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG2875-768x512.jpeg)

Within the first month of being in Taiwan, shortly after discovering Elephant Gym on PTT, I saw them perform at a memorial concert raising awareness for the [228 Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_28_incident), an anti-government uprising in 1948 that was violently suppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Recently, they've skyrocketed in popularity in the West and were even selected as the cover image for Spotify's global math rock playlist. The trio expertly combines melodies with polyrhythms on guitar, base, and drums, and sometimes even adds in earthy vocals.

They're currently on their World Tour. If anyone is interested in seeing the LA or SF shows, I have tickets to both. 

Selections:

- Midway 中途 ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/lIBGM7uYNfs?si=sM4v9DGttOfisL97))

- Go Through the Night 穿過夜晚

- Underwater

- Is There a Song that Will Make You Think of Me? (有沒有一首歌會讓你想起我)



###  Sweet John (甜約翰)

Sweet John makes love songs that are introverted in character. The music is largely absent of the hysteria and bold proclamations typical of the genre, an interviewer [noted](https://blog.pinkoi.com/tw/interviews/jq6mlq8h/) in early 2020. Instead, their lyrics provide a more realistic treatment of feelings like the anxiety inherent to an ambiguous relationship and of falling out of love in a relationship.

Selections:

- The Chance of Rainfall 降雨機率 has gotten universal acclaim from the people I've showed it to so far. "Why can't Americans make more songs like this?" was my dad's reaction. Its jazz-inspired instrumentals are as strong as its duet vocals and makes a great introduction to this genre. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3OS5IhOdUFyXzhZvuNCjgN?si=6255da935ca5460e)

- Safety Limit 安全範圍 weaves dramatic guitar riffs and drum rhythms together with a violin part and the singers' more delicate voices. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/0TMkc0N4NlnaEC6HlLPqpf?si=92098712a22540c1)

- Spark Fades 容易被厭倦的時刻 ponders the longevity of the speaker's relationship with his significant other. It begins simply with vocals and piano but gradually evolves into an intense guitar and drum-driven climax. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1LYdQTvJRRYlkj7hZq0VVT?si=8576b617473a4b07)
