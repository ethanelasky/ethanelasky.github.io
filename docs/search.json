    "text": "Delays by airline\nNow, let’s look at delays by airline. We merge wholly-owned subsidiaries with their parent company (a complete list of wholly-owned subsidiary airlines in North America can be found on Wikipedia), as people do not often see their brand nor purchase from them. Some airlines, such as Republic Airline, are regional airlines that fly under multiple airline names; our data does not represent whose banner they fly under for a given flight, making it impossible for us to merge their flights with their contracted carrier.\n\n# Add new departure hour columns to flights and delays for easier charting\nflights['CRSDepHour'], delays['CRSDepHour'] = flights['CRSDepTime'] // 1,  delays['CRSDepTime'] // 1\n\n#Select only for significant delays\ndelays = delays[delays['DepDelayMinutes'] &gt;= 30]\n\n# Merge wholly-owned subsidiary airlines with their parent companies\ndelays_ma = delays.replace(to_replace={\"Airline\": {\"Horizon Air\":\"Alaska Airlines Inc.\", \"Envoy Air\":\"American Airlines Inc.\", \"PSA Airlines Inc.\":\"American Airlines Inc.\", \"Endeavor Air Inc.\": \"Delta Air Lines Inc.\"}})\nflights_ma = flights.replace(to_replace={\"Airline\": {\"Horizon Air\":\"Alaska Airlines Inc.\", \"Envoy Air\":\"American Airlines Inc.\", \"PSA Airlines Inc.\":\"American Airlines Inc.\", \"Endeavor Air Inc.\": \"Delta Air Lines Inc.\"}})\n\n# Return a Series corresponding to an airline's delay frequency for each hour of the day\ndef airline_delay_frequencies(airline, delays, flights):\n    total_delays = delays[delays['Airline'] == airline].groupby('CRSDepHour')['CRSDepTime'].count()\n    total_flights = flights[flights['Airline'] == airline].groupby('CRSDepHour')['CRSDepTime'].count()\n    return (total_delays / total_flights).reindex(np.arange(24), fill_value=0) * 100\n\n# Accumulate multiple airline Series into a DataFrame for line plot\nairlines = ['American Airlines Inc.', #'SkyWest Airlines Inc.',\n       'Alaska Airlines Inc.', 'United Air Lines Inc.',\n       'Delta Air Lines Inc.', 'Frontier Airlines Inc.', #'Allegiant Air',\n       #'Hawaiian Airlines Inc.',\n        'Spirit Air Lines',\n       'Southwest Airlines Co.', #'Mesa Airlines Inc.', 'Republic Airline',\n       'JetBlue Airways']\nproportions = pd.DataFrame()\nfor airline in airlines:\n    proportions[airline] = airline_delay_frequencies(airline, delays_ma, flights_ma)\n\n\n# Construct a bar plot of flight delay percentage according to time\na = sns.lineplot(data=proportions, palette=\"tab10\", linewidth=2.5)\nplt.xlabel(\"Scheduled Hour of Flight Departure\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Percentage\")\nplt.title(\"Percent of flights significantly delayed, by time of day\")\nplt.xticks(range(0,24,4), ['12am','4am','8am','12pm','4pm','8pm'])\nplt.ylim(0, 40)\nsns.move_legend(a, \"upper left\", bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))\n\n\n\n\nAs a proportion of total flights, the chance of significant delay is lowest in the early hours of the morning, regardless of airline. From there, the chance of delay steadily increases and peaks in the evening. Then there is a dip around midnight, with delays skyrocketing in the wee hours of the morning.\nThe budget airlines (Frontier, Spirit, Southwest, and JetBlue) all have higher rates of delay throughout the day according to this dataset, with the exception of Southwest, which has a delay rate comparable with the non-budget airlines in the morning. However, by 12pm, Southwest’s significant delay rate grows past that of the non-budget airlines and joins its budget peers by 4 or 5 pm.\nAfter aggregating budget and non-budget airlines, we can notice a large difference between budget airline performance and non-budget performance in terms of significant delays.\nBy the numbers:\n\n(delays.groupby('Airline').count()[['CRSDepTime']] / flights.groupby('Airline').count()[['CRSDepTime']] * 100).sort_values('CRSDepTime', ascending=False).rename({'CRSDepTime':'% Flights Significantly Delayed'}, axis=1)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Flights Significantly Delayed\n\n\nAirline\n\n\n\n\n\nJetBlue Airways\n21.652816\n\n\nFrontier Airlines Inc.\n21.419026\n\n\nAllegiant Air\n18.555946\n\n\nSpirit Air Lines\n16.562758\n\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n14.770963\n\n\nAmerican Airlines Inc.\n14.214442\n\n\nMesa Airlines Inc.\n13.577397\n\n\nUnited Air Lines Inc.\n12.699216\n\n\nPSA Airlines Inc.\n10.777328\n\n\nHawaiian Airlines Inc.\n10.647634\n\n\nSkyWest Airlines Inc.\n10.414303\n\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc.\n10.389507\n\n\nRepublic Airline\n10.145860\n\n\nAlaska Airlines Inc.\n10.135582\n\n\nEndeavor Air Inc.\n9.629982\n\n\nEnvoy Air\n9.500922\n\n\nHorizon Air\n8.595466"
